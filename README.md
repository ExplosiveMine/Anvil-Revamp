#the gui is opened
#Possible values: [true, false],
# true - a sound will be played

playSound: true

#Find the list of sounds for your minecraft version.

#This is the message sent to the console when the command /anvil is executed
#Set the message to "none" to disable.
#Color codes and unicode characters work, but might glitch.
onConsoleExecuteCommand: "This command cannot be executed from the console!"

#This is the message sent to a player who does not have the permission to
#execute the command /anvil
#Set the message to "none" to disable.
#Color codes and unicode characters work, but might glitch.

#This makes it so that anvils never break or get damaged upon use. Players,
#will still be able to break them normally. When anvils fall, they will still get damaged.
#Possible values: [true, false],
# true - anvils will not break when used by players
# false - default anvil mechanics apply
# If set to true, only players with the permission \"anvil.unbreakable\" will enjoy
# having anvils that do not break. For others default, anvil mechanics apply.
unbreakableAnvils: true

#This allows items to be renamed using colour codes in anvils
#Possible values: [true, false],
# true - colour codes will work
# false - colour codes won't work
# If set to true, only players with the permission \"anvil.colour\" will enjoy
